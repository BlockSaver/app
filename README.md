# BlockSaver smart saving dapp


* **Note: requires a node version >= 7 and an npm version >= 4.**
* **If you have installation or compilation issues with this project, please see [debugging guide](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate/issues/400)**


## Run

Start the app in the `dev` environment. This starts the renderer process in [**hot-module-replacement**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hmr-react/) mode and starts a server that sends hot updates to the renderer process:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Run these two commands __simultaneously__ in different console tabs:

```bash
$ npm run start-renderer-dev
$ npm run start-main-dev
```

## Packaging

To package apps for the local platform:

```bash
$ npm run package
```

To package apps for all platforms:

First, refer to [Multi Platform Build](https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build) for dependencies.

Then,
```bash
$ npm run package-all
```

To package apps with options:

```bash
$ npm run package -- --[option]
```

## Further commands

To run the application without packaging run

```bash
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

To run End-to-End Test

```bash
$ npm run build
$ npm run test-e2e
```
